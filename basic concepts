SOC 2/ISO (compliance controls)

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) - Evaluates how well a service organization manages data to protect the privacy and interests of its clients.
Primarily used in the United States, common in SaaS and cloud providers.

ISO/IEC 27001
* Developed by: ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Global standard, recognized internationally.

If youâ€™re a SaaS company working with U.S. clients, youâ€™ll probably need SOC 2.
If you operate globally or want a structured ISMS, ISO 27001 is usually preferred.
Some companies get both to meet a wider range of client requirements.

------- Blast Radius
Definition:
The blast radius is the extent of damage or impact that a security breach, misconfiguration, or system failure can cause.

Think of it like this:
In a physical explosion, the blast radius is how far the destruction spreads. In cybersecurity, it refers to how many systems, users, or data sets could be affected if something goes wrong.

Examples:
If a hacker compromises one user account and that account has admin rights across multiple systems, the blast radius is large.
If the same account is limited to one system, the blast radius is small.

Goal:
Reduce blast radius by implementing least privilege, network segmentation, microservices, and zero trust models.

-------Surface Risk (Attack Surface Risk)
Definition:
Surface risk or attack surface refers to all possible points where an unauthorized user (attacker) could try to enter or extract data from a system.

It includes:
Open ports
Public APIs
Web apps
User accounts
Third-party integrations
Misconfigured cloud resources
The larger the surface, the more chances for attack.

Goal:
Minimize surface risk by:
Closing unused ports and endpoints
Securing APIs
Applying security hardening
Removing unnecessary services

ðŸ”‘ Key Difference
Term	Focus	Goal
Blast Radius	Impact after breach	Limit the spread of damage
Surface Risk	Entry points before breach	Reduce attack opportunities

ðŸ§  In Practice
Surface risk is about prevention.
Blast radius is about damage control.
Both are core to modern security design, especially in cloud, DevOps, and zero trust environments.

MITRE-based ------
frameworks refer to cybersecurity models and tools developed or inspired by the MITRE Corporation, a U.S. nonprofit organization known for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies.
These frameworks are widely used by security teams to understand, detect, and defend against real-world threats.

MITRE-based frameworks help cybersecurity teams better understand attacker behavior (ATT&CK), plan defenses (D3FEND), and engage threats (Engage). 
Theyâ€™re foundational for building threat-informed defense strategies.

Why MITRE-Based Frameworks Matter
Standardized language across the industry for describing threats and defenses
Backed by real-world threat intel
Supports detection engineering and security automation
Often integrated into SIEM, XDR, and SOAR tools
