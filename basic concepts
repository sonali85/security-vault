SOC 2/ISO (compliance controls)

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) - Evaluates how well a service organization manages data to protect the privacy and interests of its clients.
Primarily used in the United States, common in SaaS and cloud providers.

ISO/IEC 27001
* Developed by: ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Global standard, recognized internationally.

If you‚Äôre a SaaS company working with U.S. clients, you‚Äôll probably need SOC 2.
If you operate globally or want a structured ISMS, ISO 27001 is usually preferred.
Some companies get both to meet a wider range of client requirements.

------- Blast Radius
Definition:
The blast radius is the extent of damage or impact that a security breach, misconfiguration, or system failure can cause.

Think of it like this:
In a physical explosion, the blast radius is how far the destruction spreads. In cybersecurity, it refers to how many systems, users, or data sets could be affected if something goes wrong.

Examples:
If a hacker compromises one user account and that account has admin rights across multiple systems, the blast radius is large.
If the same account is limited to one system, the blast radius is small.

Goal:
Reduce blast radius by implementing least privilege, network segmentation, microservices, and zero trust models.

-------Surface Risk (Attack Surface Risk)
Definition:
Surface risk or attack surface refers to all possible points where an unauthorized user (attacker) could try to enter or extract data from a system.

It includes:
Open ports
Public APIs
Web apps
User accounts
Third-party integrations
Misconfigured cloud resources
The larger the surface, the more chances for attack.

Goal:
Minimize surface risk by:
Closing unused ports and endpoints
Securing APIs
Applying security hardening
Removing unnecessary services

üîë Key Difference
Term	Focus	Goal
Blast Radius	Impact after breach	Limit the spread of damage
Surface Risk	Entry points before breach	Reduce attack opportunities

üß† In Practice
Surface risk is about prevention.
Blast radius is about damage control.
Both are core to modern security design, especially in cloud, DevOps, and zero trust environments.

MITRE-based ------
frameworks refer to cybersecurity models and tools developed or inspired by the MITRE Corporation, a U.S. nonprofit organization known for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies.
These frameworks are widely used by security teams to understand, detect, and defend against real-world threats.

MITRE-based frameworks help cybersecurity teams better understand attacker behavior (ATT&CK), plan defenses (D3FEND), and engage threats (Engage). 
They‚Äôre foundational for building threat-informed defense strategies.

Why MITRE-Based Frameworks Matter
Standardized language across the industry for describing threats and defenses
Backed by real-world threat intel
Supports detection engineering and security automation
Often integrated into SIEM, XDR, and SOAR tools


 TPRM tool -------
A TPRM tool refers to a Third-Party Risk Management tool ‚Äî software designed to help organizations identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks posed by third-party vendors, partners, or suppliers.

üîê What is TPRM?
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) is the process of evaluating and managing the risks associated with external vendors who have access to your data, systems, or services.
These risks can include:
Security risks (e.g., data breaches)
Compliance risks (e.g., SOC 2, ISO, GDPR violations)
Operational risks (e.g., downtime, supply chain issues)
Reputational risks

üß∞ What Does a TPRM Tool Do?
A TPRM tool typically offers:

Feature	Description
Vendor Inventory	Track all third parties your company works with.
Risk Assessments	Send and manage security questionnaires (e.g., SIG, CAIQ).
Document Management	Collect and store SOC 2, ISO, pen tests, etc.
Automated Workflows	Streamline vendor onboarding, approvals, and reviews.
Continuous Monitoring	Track changes in vendor security posture using external signals.
Reporting & Audit Support	Export evidence and reports for internal/external audits.

üõ† Examples of TPRM Tools
OneTrust
SecurityScorecard
CyberGRX
RiskRecon
Prevalent
Archer
BitSight
Panorays

Some compliance automation platforms like Drata, Vanta, and Secureframe also offer basic TPRM features.

‚úÖ Why Use a TPRM Tool?
Reduces manual effort in vendor reviews
Improves audit readiness
Supports regulatory compliance
Helps prioritize vendors based on actual risk


What Is a CISO?
CISO stands for Chief Information Security Officer ‚Äî the executive responsible for an organization‚Äôs information and cybersecurity strategy.

üîê Key Responsibilities of a CISO
Area	Role of the CISO
Security Strategy	Defines and leads the company‚Äôs overall security roadmap.
Risk Management	Identifies and mitigates cybersecurity risks.
Policy & Governance	Creates and enforces security policies and compliance.
Security Operations	Oversees incident response, threat detection, and defense.
Compliance & Audits	Ensures the organization meets SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.
Security Architecture	Approves tools, systems, and infrastructure security.
Board Reporting	Communicates security posture and risks to executives.
Team Leadership	Manages security analysts, engineers, and compliance staff.

üß† What CISOs Care About
Data protection
Breach prevention
Third-party/vendor risk
Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, ISO)
Security ROI and metrics
Secure cloud transformation
Executive & board communication

ü§ù Common Tools CISOs Use
SIEMs (Splunk, Sumo Logic, etc.)
TPRM tools (CyberGRX, OneTrust)
Compliance platforms (Drata, Vanta)
Vulnerability scanners (Qualys, Tenable)
EDR/XDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)
Security dashboards for reporting

üö® CISO in the Org Chart
Typically reports to:
CIO (Chief Information Officer)
Or directly to the CEO or Board, especially in security-driven organizations.
