SOC 2/ISO (compliance controls)

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) - Evaluates how well a service organization manages data to protect the privacy and interests of its clients.
Primarily used in the United States, common in SaaS and cloud providers.

ISO/IEC 27001
* Developed by: ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Global standard, recognized internationally.

If you‚Äôre a SaaS company working with U.S. clients, you‚Äôll probably need SOC 2.
If you operate globally or want a structured ISMS, ISO 27001 is usually preferred.
Some companies get both to meet a wider range of client requirements.

------- Blast Radius
Definition:
The blast radius is the extent of damage or impact that a security breach, misconfiguration, or system failure can cause.

Think of it like this:
In a physical explosion, the blast radius is how far the destruction spreads. In cybersecurity, it refers to how many systems, users, or data sets could be affected if something goes wrong.

Examples:
If a hacker compromises one user account and that account has admin rights across multiple systems, the blast radius is large.
If the same account is limited to one system, the blast radius is small.

Goal:
Reduce blast radius by implementing least privilege, network segmentation, microservices, and zero trust models.

-------Surface Risk (Attack Surface Risk)
Definition:
Surface risk or attack surface refers to all possible points where an unauthorized user (attacker) could try to enter or extract data from a system.

It includes:
Open ports
Public APIs
Web apps
User accounts
Third-party integrations
Misconfigured cloud resources
The larger the surface, the more chances for attack.

Goal:
Minimize surface risk by:
Closing unused ports and endpoints
Securing APIs
Applying security hardening
Removing unnecessary services

üîë Key Difference
Term	Focus	Goal
Blast Radius	Impact after breach	Limit the spread of damage
Surface Risk	Entry points before breach	Reduce attack opportunities

üß† In Practice
Surface risk is about prevention.
Blast radius is about damage control.
Both are core to modern security design, especially in cloud, DevOps, and zero trust environments.

MITRE-based ------
frameworks refer to cybersecurity models and tools developed or inspired by the MITRE Corporation, a U.S. nonprofit organization known for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies.
These frameworks are widely used by security teams to understand, detect, and defend against real-world threats.

MITRE-based frameworks help cybersecurity teams better understand attacker behavior (ATT&CK), plan defenses (D3FEND), and engage threats (Engage). 
They‚Äôre foundational for building threat-informed defense strategies.

Why MITRE-Based Frameworks Matter
Standardized language across the industry for describing threats and defenses
Backed by real-world threat intel
Supports detection engineering and security automation
Often integrated into SIEM, XDR, and SOAR tools


 TPRM tool -------
A TPRM tool refers to a Third-Party Risk Management tool ‚Äî software designed to help organizations identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks posed by third-party vendors, partners, or suppliers.

üîê What is TPRM?

üõ°Ô∏è What Is MSSP Mode?----
MSSP mode refers to how a cybersecurity product or platform can be configured or licensed for use by an MSSP ‚Äî a Managed Security Services Provider ‚Äî rather than just a single organization.

üîç What is an MSSP?
An MSSP (Managed Security Services Provider) is a third-party company that monitors, manages, and responds to security threats for multiple clients. Think of them as outsourced security teams.

üéØ What "MSSP Mode" Typically Means
When a tool or platform offers an MSSP mode, it usually includes features that support multi-tenant security operations, such as:

Feature	Purpose
Multi-Tenant Management	Support multiple client environments from one console.
Client Isolation	Ensure data, logs, and alerts are separated by customer.
Custom Branding	White-label the service with MSSP's branding.
Role-Based Access Control	Define which MSSP analysts can access which clients.
Centralized Dashboard	View alerts, health, or metrics across all clients.
Automated Reporting	Generate client-specific reports (e.g., compliance, detections).
API Access & Integration	Hook into external ticketing, SOAR, or threat intel systems.
Flexible Licensing	Pricing models that match MSSPs' recurring revenue setup.

üõ† Examples of Tools with MSSP Mode
CrowdStrike Falcon Platform
SentinelOne
Splunk MSSP Edition

You need to scale operations securely without managing dozens of separate instances


GDPR / SOC 2 Alignment ‚Äî -------
While GDPR and SOC 2 are different in scope and origin, they overlap in key areas, especially around data protection, security controls, and accountability. 
Aligning them helps companies streamline compliance and reduce audit fatigue.

üßæ What They Are
Framework	Description
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)	EU regulation focused on personal data protection and privacy rights of individuals.
SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)	U.S.-based audit standard that evaluates how service providers manage customer data, focusing on security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy.

üîÑ Key Overlaps
Area	GDPR	SOC 2
Data Protection	Requires safeguarding personal data	- Security & confidentiality criteria
Access Controls	Limit access to personal data - 	Control over logical and physical access
Data Minimization	Only collect necessary data --	Part of processing integrity & privacy
Incident Response	Breach notification within 72 hours -- 	Must have a formal incident response plan
Vendor Management	Requires due diligence on processors --- 	Evaluated under risk and third-party controls
Data Subject Rights	Right to access, delete, correct data	 --- Covered in Privacy Trust Criteria
Risk Assessment	Ongoing DPIAs (Data Protection Impact Assessments)	 --- Risk assessments are a SOC 2 requirement
Audits & Documentation	Must prove compliance	--- Audit reports document control design and effectiveness

üß† How to Align Them
Map GDPR articles to SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (especially Security, Confidentiality, and Privacy).
Use SOC 2 controls to demonstrate technical and organizational measures required under GDPR.
Ensure your SOC 2 privacy principle (if included) covers data subject rights, consent, and retention.
Document policies and procedures that satisfy both frameworks (e.g., breach response, vendor risk, data classification).
Use compliance automation tools (like Drata, Vanta, or Secureframe) to track control alignment.

üéØ TL;DR
SOC 2 ‚â† GDPR, but many SOC 2 controls support GDPR compliance.
To align them:
Use SOC 2 to cover technical safeguards
Add GDPR-specific policies for legal rights (consent, deletion, etc.)
This approach simplifies audits and shows a strong security and privacy posture to customers.
