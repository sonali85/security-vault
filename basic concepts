SOC 2/ISO

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) - Evaluates how well a service organization manages data to protect the privacy and interests of its clients.
Primarily used in the United States, common in SaaS and cloud providers.

ISO/IEC 27001
* Developed by: ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Global standard, recognized internationally.

If you’re a SaaS company working with U.S. clients, you’ll probably need SOC 2.
If you operate globally or want a structured ISMS, ISO 27001 is usually preferred.
Some companies get both to meet a wider range of client requirements.
